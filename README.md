# WheelPuzzle

This is an Octave script that mimics a ring puzzle popularly invented (as far as I know) by Paper Mario - The Origami King.

This puzzle has some interesting mathematic properties, for instance it features periodic boundaries along the angular coordinate and mirrored modulo periodic boundaries along the radial coordinate. It therefore topologically lives on a sphere, but pieces have to be mirrored along the poles if they move across.

A way to visualize this is to draw the pieces on a diamond-like shape.
